# __PD GUIDE__

Best way to pd:

**1.  Wait until you have the TAX COLLECTOR VICTORY boost. It's +30% pd**

**2. Wait till we have highest guild buff for market tax reduction**

(If you a propro, you can also try to wait for these things to happen during Halloween with good spooker boost and get erngy clover3 and 4. All possible boosts is +55% pd during that time)

**3. Sell anything above -17%**

 -17% -> +40% = sell
-40% -> -18% = keep
(If we are market Manipulating something, you have to hold it or talk with me so you don't mess up the push) 

**4.  Sell all investment stonks**

**5. Sell farms**
(It may be smart to buy free forests and assign so you don't get raided while you buying and selling ) 

**6.. Buy something that is -40% until you have 0 idlons.**

**7. BUY ALL DEBTS**

**8. Do pd**

**9. You have 30 minutes to get farms and assign workers before you can get raided.**
 I suggest doing a few raids to get some resources, sell them, and buy best farms you can before 30 mins is up.
