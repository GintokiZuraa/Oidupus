## 7. Team farm life upgrade (TFL)
- only needed if you are in the top 12 power level of our guild. You can check by typing "Molly guild"
- if you ARE top 12, or will be soon, you need to upgrade to TFL 3
- if you are not, then ignore this one

## 8. Farm bundle 
- Important! 
- buy as soon as you are able, and save idlucks if you are closed to another league so you can buy the next bundle when you reach. You can check bundle leagues with "idle league rewards"

## 9. Quality of life 
- Important!
- it's supposed to be an idle game, why not buy things to make it easier? 

## 10. Roll luck
- somewhat important 
- raid is better than roll most of the time, but it's good to have this eventually. 

## 11. Activity discount 
- Important!
- especially important with event markets 
- upgrade evenly with ?

## 12. Claim time 
-  good for increased production 

2, 3, 4, 5, 11 & 12 are all important to upgrade somewhat evenly. (10 roll currently bad, but will be buffed eventually)

1, 8, and 9 only do as available or needed

6 <:bonk:1191592547462688768> bad

If you play a lot throughout the day, focus on 2 
If you just play once or twice a day, focus on 4 and 11
Always focus on 3 and 5
